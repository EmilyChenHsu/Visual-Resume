I didn't even know there was a migration.rb file - especially not one that could be removed so easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor kicks, I decided to try and trick the command console by adding the letter x to the end of word migration - and received this message:\\r\\n\\r\\nMB-A:sample_app sm$ rails destroy migrationx add_delta_to_submissions delta:integer\\r\\nCould not find generator migrationx.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I think there could be a bug with the rails destroy command.  Once it realized there was no longer a add_delta_to_submissions.rb file, it just lopped that off and tacked on the .rb to the word migration (or any word after DESTROY).  That seems a bit dangerous....\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of that - I am curious to know if I have somehow compromised my RAILS environment now that the migration.rb file has been removed.
