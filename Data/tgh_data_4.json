These types of problems take a very long time to track down, which is why I think we should fix this issue. \\r\\n\\r\\nExample:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\n2.0.0p247 :034 > cache = ActiveSupport::Cache.lookup_store :memory_store, size: 100\\r\\n => <#ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore entries=0, size=0, options={:size=>100}>\\r\\n2.0.0p247 :035 > key_prefix = '*' * 50\\r\\n => \\\"**************************************************\\\"\\r\\n2.0.0p247 :036 > cache.fetch(\\\"#{key_prefix}-1\\\") { 0 }\\r\\n => 0\\r\\n2.0.0p247 :037 > cache.fetch(\\\"#{key_prefix}-2\\\") { 0 }\\r\\n => 0\\r\\n2.0.0p247 :038 > cache\\r\\n => <#ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore entries=2, size=8, options={:size=>100}>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe example shows a situation where the cache uses much more than 100 bytes yet it calculates its size to be 8.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'd be happy to create a pull request for a fix but first I wanted to make sure this makes sense to others. One question that comes to mind is what to use to calculate the size of the key. Calling `key.to_s.bytesize` or `Marshal.dump(key).bytesize` is easy but the key serialization would add a serious performance penalty for non-string keys. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn that note, it seems that the only reason `MemoryStore` uses `Marshal` is to calculate the cache size (yet gets it quite wrong). Is that really worth the overhead? Should we create a shortcut for developers, e.g., a `#cached_size` method on an object that `MemoryStore` can check for and call first instead of marshaling? Of course, that would require using a modified `Entry`, e.g., `InMemoryEntry` but the benefit could be a significant performance increase at the expense of some memory overhead (marshaled data structures take less space than live ones). In profiled runs I've done with multiple diverse caches under load 40% of the time spent in `MemoryStore#fetch` is due to the use of `Marshal`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe areas where keys should be taken into account are:\\r\\n\\r\\n- https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/commit\\/ee51b51b60f9e6cce9babed2c8a65a14d87790c8#L5R141\\r\\n\\r\\n- https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/commit\\/ee51b51b60f9e6cce9babed2c8a65a14d87790c8#L5R153\"","date":"2013-07","title":"\"ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore calculates memory usage incorrectly leading to out-of-memory conditions\"","ismerged":null,"repo":"rails/rails","openclose":"close"},"3279":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/11497","body":"\"As ```ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionManagement``` middleware does not rescue from Exception (but only from StandardError), the Connection Pool quickly runs out of connections when multiple erroneous Requests come in right after each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nclass TestController < ActionController::Base\\r\\n  def eat_connection\\r\\n    # do something with the DB\\r\\n    raise Exception('lost a connection')\\r\\n  end\\r\\n\\r\\n  def release_all_connections\\r\\n    head :ok\\r\\n  end\\r\\nend\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nCall ```\\/test\\/eat_connection``` as many times as you have connections in your pool and the application becomes unresponsive, until the connections timeout and are returned to the pool.\\r\\n\\r\\nCall ```\\/test\\/eat_connection``` a few times, followed by ```\\/test\\/release_all_connections``` and the entire pool becomes available again.

This is how rails generator for engine would set it up for you by default:\\n```ruby\\nmodule TestEngine\\n  class TestController < ApplicationController\\n    def index\\n    end\\n  end\\nend\\n```\\n\\nIf for any reason ::ApplicationController already was accessed prior to getting in TestController, TestController will inherit from main app ApplicationController instead of TestEngine::ApplicationController...\\n\\nThis is an issue with any module\\/class names that are same but seperated with engine namespace like ::ApplicationController and ::TestEngine::ApplicationController... \\n\\n\"","date":"2012-05","title":"\"Engine classes not loaded in dev mode if class with same name was already loaded in main app\"","ismerged":null,"repo":"rails/rails","openclose":"close"},"3326":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6409","body":"\"Changed `AbstractController::Callbacks` to use `define_method` when creating `before_filter`, `after_filter`, etc. instead of `class_eval`.\"","date":"2012-05","title":"\"Refactor Filter Methods\"","ismerged":"false","repo":"rails/rails","openclose":"close"},"3327":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6391","body":"\"This pull request fixes route inspection for routes that are redirection.\\n\\nroutes.rb:\\n\\n```ruby\\nFooBar::Application.routes.draw do\\n  match \\\"\\/foo\\\" => redirect(\\\"\\/bar\\\")\\nend\\n```\\n\\n`rake routes` now:\\n\\n```\\nfoo  \\/foo(.:format) :controller#:action\\\"\\n```\\n\\nafter patch, fixed:\\n\\n```\\nfoo  \\/foo(.:format)  Redirect (301)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\"","date":"2012-05","title":"\"Redirect route inspect\"","ismerged":"true","repo":"rails/rails","openclose":"close"},"3328":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6389","body":"\"In my application I have an engine with routes defined inside it like the code below:\\n```ruby\\nProstPoll::Engine.routes.draw do\\n  resources :polls do\\n    resources :answers, :only => :update\\n  end\\nend\\n```\\nInside the engine we're using ```isolate_namespace ProstPoll``` to allow routes to be used without namespaces.

The reason is it really has year 2012 in the database.\\n\\nI realize the year is just a dummy year since Ruby doesn't support any concept of time only.  But the difference is MySQL and PostgreSQL don't actually store the year in the database, where as SQLite does, and it doesn't match what Rails displays.\\n\\nAs an aside, I had to add:\\n\\n``` ruby\\nActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_attributes = false\\nActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone = :local\\nTime.zone = nil\\n```\\nto a couple of the tests, because when I changed line 955 to skip SQLite3 adapter, those lines getting skipped at the end were causing those other two tests to fail.

It requires some restructuring and slight uglification of the ConnectionPool.checkout method. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a tricky one. I have a test, but due to the race condition nature of the bug, it only sometimes fails, so I didn't include it it in the pull commit not sure if that was appropriate, but it's included below. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem occurs when you have a lot of threads (more than connection pool size) all wanting to checkout connections for very very short periods of time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConceptually, this ought to be accommodated no problem. Each thread only needs the connection for a very short period of time, orders of magnitude less than the timeout -- even if there's more of them then there are connections, they should each be able to take a turn, waiting when neccesary and all finishing long before timeout no problem. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, _sometimes_ (race condition, so it appears in some runs and not others), some of these threads will end up raising a ConnectionTimeoutError  --- **long before** the timeout value is reached. They appear to be giving up and not getting a connection in miliseconds, long before the 5 second time out. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? As far as I can tell, here's the deal.  \\r\\n\\r\\n* threadA wants a connection, but the pool is full, so it blocks on [`@queue.wait(@timeout)`](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/3-2-stable\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/connection_adapters\\/abstract\\/connection_pool.rb#L246)\\r\\n\\r\\n* shortly thereafter, threadB checks in a connection, and does a [`@queue.signal`](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/3-2-stable\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/connection_adapters\\/abstract\\/connection_pool.rb#L270)\\r\\n\\r\\n* this does wake up threadA, however threadA does not immediately get access to the mutex to be in it's 'synchronization' block. Some *other* thread slips into 'synchronization' first, checks out the newly avail conenction, and then at a later point threadA gets access to the mutex 'synchronization' block\\r\\n** It [finds there are no connections available](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/3-2-stable\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/connection_adapters\\/abstract\\/connection_pool.rb#L248), assumes this means that it only woke up from `@queue.wait` because of a timeout, and throws the ConnectionTimeoutError . But the 5 seconds hadn't elapsed, hardly any time at all elapsed, it got woken up because there was a checkin, another thread just stole it first. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt first this seemed to be like it must be a bug in ruby Monitor\\/ConditionVariable itself, or else ConnectionPool somehow not synchronizing in enough places, or something. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, reading up on how Monitors and ConditionVariables work, this seems like *one* accepted model for the way they work -- and appears to be how ruby works.  The [wikipedia article on Monitors](http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Monitor_(synchronization)) refers to these two models as \\\"blocking condition variables\\\" and [\\\"non-blocking condition variables\\\"](http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Monitor_(synchronization)#Nonblocking_condition_variables)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis [article on Java](http:\\/\\/www.baptiste-wicht.com\\/2010\\/09\\/java-concurrency-part-5-monitors-locks-and-conditions\\/) refers to the two categories instead as \\\"Signal & Continue\\\" (non-blocking) and \\\"Signal & Wait\\\" (blocking), and says Java uses the \\\"Signal & Continue\\\" method:\\r\\n\\r\\n> Signal & Continue (SC) : The process who signal keep the mutual exclusion and the signaled will be awaken but need to acquire the mutual exclusion before going.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat appears to be what ruby is doing too, although Monitor rdoc doesn't specify, and I wasn't able to understand the code enough to be sure -- that matches observed behavior here. So, the process which signals keeps the mutex, the signaled awakens but just gets added to the queue to aquire the mutex to operate in it's 'synchronized' block, and other threads may in front of it. Yep, that's happening. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere's a test case which on my machine fails in about 80% of runs. Tested with both MRI 1.9.3-p0 and jruby 1.6.7 in 1.8.7 mode.  That jruby has the same race condition is not surprising based on info that Java also uses the non-blocking\\/Signal-and-continue approach. \\r\\n\\r\\n     def test_wait_on_connection\\r\\n        main_connections = []\\r\\n        \\r\\n        # Fill er up\\r\\n        (pool.spec.config[:pool] || 5).times do\\r\\n          main_connections << pool.checkout\\r\\n        end\\r\\n        \\r\\n        threads = []\\r\\n        10.times do\\r\\n          threads << Thread.new do            \\r\\n            pool.with_connection do |conn|\\r\\n              assert conn\\r\\n              sleep 0.01\\r\\n            end\\r\\n          end\\r\\n        end\\r\\n\\r\\n        pool.checkin main_connections.shift\\r\\n\\r\\n        assert_nothing_raised do\\r\\n          threads.each {|t| t.join}\\r\\n        end\\r\\n\\r\\n        main_connections.each {|c| pool.checkin c}\\r\\n\\r\\n      end\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the included pull request, test fails due to race condition approximately 80% of runs on my machine, may differ on yours. (adding more runs to the `10 times` may make it more likely to fail) Note that if you run just this test by itself, on failure run, it completes with failure in _way_ less than the 5 second timeout, even though it reports a failure due to ConnectionTimeoutError \\\"could not get connection in 5 seconds.\\\"  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the included pull request, I was not able to get the test to fail in a bunch of runs -- and additionally my much more complex app no longer exhibited the problematic behavior I was seeing, where it raised ConnectionTimeoutError's when I didn't see any reason why, unless given a larger connection pool than seemed like should be neccesary. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe restructure in the pull request changes the order of operations in the loop in `#checkout`, but it also has to do some ugly things with keeping track itself of how long it slept during the `@queue.wait`. I couldn't think of any other way for it to determine whether the timeout was really up, in cases where it returned from `@queue.wait` with a connection still unavailable. It may execute multiple `@queue.wait`s in successive loop iterations.  The total of all of them should be no more than _approximately_ the timeout value, as it keeps a running count of waiting time.  This is neccessarily not _exactly_ the @timeout value because there's really no way to get that exact measure, but it'll be pretty close, and should be good enough for what @timeout is meant to accomplish. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot sure if there's an existing test that asserts that when a thread really _can't_ get a connection it does raise ConnectionTimeout, and in about 5 seconds -- but I verified myself this was still true post-commit. (such a test would take 5 seconds to complete, which would be annoying, unless perhaps using a pool with a much smaller timeout). \\r\\n\\r\\nPhew. Hope I explained this clearly using no more words than needed, although it took a lot of words. \"","date":"2012-03","title":"\"ConnectionPool.checkout needs to be restructured to take account of ruby's \\\"non-blocking\\\" strategy for mutex ConditionVariables\"","ismerged":null,"repo":"rails/rails","openclose":"close"},"3423":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5420","body":"\"\"","date":"2012-03","title":"\"add include_hidden option to checkbox tag\"","ismerged":"true","repo":"rails/rails","openclose":"close"},"3424":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5414","body":"\"\"","date":"2012-03","title":"\"add 'include_hidden' option to select tag, closes #5402\"","ismerged":"true","repo":"rails/rails","openclose":"close"},"3425":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5402","body":"\"Now Rails generates hidden field before every multiple select.

I can do `StockTrade.where(:id => 1)`, or `StockTrade.find_by_id(1)`.

mounted engine, so a path to blog's post\\ncan be generated using user_blog.post_path(user, post).\\n\\nThe problem I'm fixing here is that mount used a raw :as option, without\\ntaking nestings into account. As a result, blog was added to a route set\\nas a `user_blog`, but helper was generated for just `blog`.\\n\\nThis commit applies the proper logic for defining a helper for a mounted\\nengine nested in resources or resource block.\\n\\n(closes #8533)\"","date":"2013-10","hash":"e6c602da9046a653747ce99c9cab7f08f572fa40","state":"error","centrality":"median","repo":"rails/rails"},"9106":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/445f14e97553de552745de26ebd5e49bc5c82f4e","message":"\"Fix asset_path in mounted engine\\n\\nHistorically serving assets from a mountable engine could be achieved by\\nrunning ActionDispatch::Static as a part of engine middleware stack or\\nto copy assets prefixed with an engine name.

However, it's virtually impossible to predict every case of framework extension. If there is anything that can't be done with current API, people should open issues (or better pull requests).\\n\\nAlso, I was not trying to say that people use rails internals, mainly because rails doesn't provide good APIs. It can be the case, but most of the time I've seen code that tried to be \\\"too clever\\\" in my opinion - a lot of things can be achieved in many different ways and often code that touch internals can be refactored into proper implementation that doesn't do it.\\n\\n> I have an impression that you gave up and prefer to stick to older rails patch level instead of promoting fixed version - which fixes security issues (because that's what you do for every patch version increase).\\n\\nI haven't given up. I think that people **should** be on the latest stable release. The thing is, changing `Gemfile` will not force people to upgrade. I've seen **a lot** of apps that **can't** be upgraded because a lot of things breaks after upgrading to next version - in such situation they will not upgrade, they will hardcode current version in `Gemfile` anyway.\\n\\nThe other thing is, I see a little problem with your reasoning. You say that people will upgrade version **only** after running `bundle update rails` or `bundle update` intentionally. And in the same time you say that having the number hardcoded in `Gemfile` will keep people from intentional upgrades.\\n\\nI assume that given that most rails apps are hard to upgrade painlessly and `~>` operator in `Gemfile`, people will just avoid `bundle update` until they explicitly want to upgrade, which will have similar effect that hardcoding version - in both situations upgrade is done when needed.

I fixed it here: 0e69705, but this was not causing any problems with order itself, as repeated application was added with lower priority, so it was ignored anyway.\\n\\nThe real problem is, while you now can set the order of loading engines, helpers method that loads all of the helpers for controller is basically ignoring the order of directories. The fix is here: 26ddf2fa, but I'm not sure if I can apply it to 3-2-stable branch, because it will change the current order of loading helpers. It will probably have very little impact on most of the apps, though (to break, application would need to load helpers from more than one path and rely on overriding helpers based on alphabetical ordering of 2 files from different directories).\\n\\n@josevalim @jeremy @spastorino what do you guys think about changing that?\"","issueno":6496,"repo":"rails/rails"},"4923":{"date":"2012-05","parent_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6496","body":"\"@spastorino yeah, that will be probably the safest way\"","issueno":6496,"repo":"rails/rails"},"4924":{"date":"2012-09","parent_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6478","body":"\"Also, do we decide to implement one of the options that @josevalim mentioned?

If I recall correctly, in rails 2, one of the plugins made it possible by creating migrations in app's db directory that had instructions on which engine's migration should be ran (to keep timeline), so you also had to add that migrations to version control.\\r\\n\\r\\n> I'm not sure I understood what do you mean. I thought migration files\\r\\n> required only for the rake db:migrate task. Are they also required to\\r\\n> actually run my app?\\r\\n\\r\\nThey're not required to *start* your app, but in order to run it, you need to have cosistent db state and without those migrations in version control you will not have the items that they create. All I mean by that is that if you don't put them in version control you will not have them migrated on production database, which will most likely fail later.\\r\\n\\r\\n> AFAIK, this approach was used in Rails 2. Why it was changed?\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch approach was not available in rails out of the box, so please specify which plugin are you referring to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution like that was chosen after a few discussions with rails core team. One of the main points is that if you run migrations from another directory, by running some code, you have limited ability to view the migration's content, which can be destructive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing with timestamps (ie. versions) was also the problem in rails 2 and some of the plugins were fixing it, but with a different approach. I've found one of the posts that described the problems and possible solutions: http:\\/\\/interblah.net\\/plugin-migrations Anyway, this approach will not likely change now. If you want to discuss it further, please write a post on rubyonrails-core group: https:\\/\\/groups.google.com\\/forum\\/?fromgroups#!forum\\/rubyonrails-core.
