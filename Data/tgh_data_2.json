This is because it is not specified in the [gemspec](http:\\/\\/docs.rubygems.org\\/read\\/chapter\\/20#license) of your last release.\\n\\nvia e.g.\\n\\n    spec.license = 'MIT'\\n    # or\\n    spec.licenses = ['MIT', 'GPL-2']\\n\\nIncluding a license in your gemspec is an easy way for rubygems.org and other tools to check how your gem is licensed.  As you can imagine, scanning your repository for a LICENSE file or parsing the README, and then attempting to identify the license or licenses is much more difficult and more error prone. So, even for projects that already specify a license, including a license in your gemspec is a good practice. See, for example, how [rubygems.org uses the gemspec to  display the rails gem license](https:\\/\\/rubygems.org\\/gems\\/rails).\\n\\nThere is even a [License Finder gem](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/pivotal\\/LicenseFinder) to help companies\\/individuals ensure all gems they use meet their licensing needs. This tool depends on license information being available in the gemspec.  This is an important enough issue that *even Bundler now generates gems with a default 'MIT' license*.\\n\\nI hope you'll consider specifying a license in your gemspec. If not, please just close the issue with a nice message. In either case, I'll follow up. Thanks for your time!\\n\\nAppendix:\\n\\nIf you need help choosing a [license](http:\\/\\/opensource.org\\/licenses) (sorry, I haven't checked your readme or looked for a license file), GitHub has created a [license picker tool](http:\\/\\/choosealicense.com\\/).  Code without a license specified defaults to 'All rights reserved'-- denying others all rights to use of the code.\\nHere's a [list of the license names I've found and their frequencies](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/bf4\\/gemproject\\/blob\\/master\\/license_usage.csv)\\n\\np.s. In case you're wondering how I found you and why I made this issue, it's because I'm collecting stats on gems (I was originally looking for download data) and decided to collect license metadata,too, and [make issues for gemspecs not specifying a license as a public service :)](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/bf4\\/gemproject\\/issues\\/1).

By using a single RegExp match rather than two, things speed up quite a bit.  This still isn't optimal, but I got hung up trying to deal with corner cases.  That \\\"1_000\\\" is an int, but \\\"_100\\\" is a String really messes with things.  As a result, any String that starts with a digit ends up following the unhappy path right now, even if it contains a clearly non-number character later in the String.  Someone better at RegExp might be able to get that working.  I could only do it through some really messy disjunctions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this change, the tokenization process is no longer a hot spot in some VCR-heavy tests I have.

Next call to encode_with generates new temporary data and might reuse the object_id, passes that to psych and psych links the two distinct objects using yaml alias syntax because they are \\\"the same\\\" as far as psych's concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe simplest solution is probably disabling garbage collection for the duration of a dump, next simplest is holding on to the \\\"registered\\\" objects (also for the duration of the dump). \"","date":"2012-04","title":"\"Aliasing of distinct objects due to garbage collection during a dump\"","ismerged":null,"repo":"tenderlove/psych","openclose":"close"},"164":{"url":"https://github.com/tenderlove/psych/pull/57","body":"\"Calling 'rails db' causes ==>\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\/home\\/akt\\/.rvm\\/rubies\\/ruby-1.9.3-p125\\/lib\\/ruby\\/1.9.1\\/psych\\/visitors\\/to_ruby.rb:221:in `merge!': can't convert nil into Hash (TypeError)\\r\\n\\r\\nLine 221 at my version equates to line 257 at the version I patch here.\\r\\nApplying my patch the error removed and the console opened.\"","date":"2012-04","title":"\"Solve an error using 'rails db'\"","ismerged":"false","repo":"tenderlove/psych","openclose":"close"},"165":{"url":"https://github.com/tenderlove/psych/issues/56","body":"\"With a recent RubyInstaller build of `ruby_1_9_3` I get the following error from a custom app. I've tried tweaking `psych.rb` but the only workaround I've found is to `chcp 65001` my `cmd.exe` as `chcp 1252` and the default `chcp 437` fails.\\r\\n\\r\\n    C:\\\\Users\\\\Jon>lackee map\\r\\n    C:\\/ruby193\\/lib\\/ruby\\/1.9.1\\/psych.rb:206:in `parse': YAML file must be UTF-8, UTF-16LE, or UTF-16BE, not IBM437 (ArgumentError)\\r\\n    from C:\\/ruby193\\/lib\\/ruby\\/1.9.1\\/psych.rb:206:in `parse_stream'\\r\\n    from C:\\/ruby193\\/lib\\/ruby\\/1.9.1\\/psych.rb:289:in `load_stream'\\r\\n    from C:\\/ruby193\\/lib\\/ruby\\/1.9.1\\/psych\\/deprecated.rb:28:in `load_documents'\\r\\n    from C:\\/ruby193\\/lib\\/ruby\\/gems\\/1.9.1\\/gems\\/logging-1.7.2\\/lib\\/logging\\/config\\/yaml_configurator.rb:53:in `initialize'\\r\\n    from C:\\/ruby193\\/lib\\/ruby\\/gems\\/1.9.1\\/gems\\/logging-1.7.2\\/lib\\/logging\\/config\\/yaml_configurator.rb:37:in `new'\\r\\n    from C:\\/ruby193\\/lib\\/ruby\\/gems\\/1.9.1\\/gems\\/logging-1.7.2\\/lib\\/logging\\/config\\/yaml_configurator.rb:37:in `load'\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm working to extract a simple test case for you, but the relevant part of my code simply uses\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/github.com\\/TwP\\/logging\\/blob\\/master\\/lib\\/logging\\/config\\/yaml_configurator.rb#L24\\r\\n\\r\\nlike `  Logging::Config::YamlConfigurator.load(CONFIG_FILE.realpath.to_s)`\\r\\n\\r\\nMy ruby environment:\\r\\n\\r\\n    C:\\\\Users\\\\Jon>ripl\\r\\n    >> RUBY_DESCRIPTION\\r\\n    => \\\"ruby 1.9.3p174 (2012-04-03 revision 35222) [i386-mingw32]\\\"\\r\\n    >> require 'psych'; Psych::VERSION\\r\\n    => \\\"1.3.1\\\"\\r\\n    >> Gem::VERSION\\r\\n    => \\\"1.8.21\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI suspect https:\\/\\/github.com\\/tenderlove\\/psych\\/commit\\/9eb12645b1ab380db738029edcf08cf1c4220607 and am working on more info.

Our database connections were being terminated by an HAProxy in our setup that terminates idle TCP connections, which Rails 3.2 had no issue with --- it would detect the dead connection and establish a new connection without issue. Rails 4 on the other hand does not. A subsequent request cycle caused a new connection to be created, which would then work as long as that connection was not killed as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt turns out, [Rails already has a unit test to verify that a dead connection is properly detected](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/v4.0.1\\/activerecord\\/test\\/cases\\/adapters\\/postgresql\\/connection_test.rb#L91), but it is \\\"skipped\\\" by default because it requires a human to manually restart the PostgreSQL database (although there are ways this could be automated).

However, `PQconnectPoll()` is meant for setting up a Postgres client connection in a non-blocking manner after the connection's socket is ready for reading\\/writing (as determined by `select()` or `poll()`) --- it does not actually perform any health checks on the connection. In fact, if the last known state of the connection is good, it immediately returns:\\r\\n\\r\\n([From src\\/interface\\/libpq\\/fe-connect.c in the postgresql source](http:\\/\\/git.postgresql.org\\/gitweb\\/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src\\/interfaces\\/libpq\\/fe-connect.c;h=18fcb0c23724c7344f62f36adcb4f5ef9b0c73dc;hb=HEAD#l1553))\\r\\n\\r\\n```C\\r\\nPostgresPollingStatusType\\r\\nPQconnectPoll(PGconn *conn)\\r\\n{\\r\\n\\tPGresult   *res;\\r\\n\\tchar\\t\\tsebuf[256];\\r\\n\\tint\\t\\t\\toptval;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tif (conn == NULL)\\r\\n\\t\\treturn PGRES_POLLING_FAILED;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\/* Get the new data *\\/\\r\\n\\tswitch (conn->status)\\r\\n\\t{\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\/*\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t * We really shouldn't have been polled in these two cases, but we\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t * can handle it.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t *\\/\\r\\n\\t\\tcase CONNECTION_BAD:\\r\\n\\t\\t\\treturn PGRES_POLLING_FAILED;\\r\\n\\t\\tcase CONNECTION_OK:\\r\\n\\t\\t\\treturn PGRES_POLLING_OK;\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means that `connect_poll` is not sufficient for detecting an inactive connection that has been closed by the other end. [The Rails 3.2.15 version of `active?`](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/v3.2.15\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/connection_adapters\\/postgresql_adapter.rb#L341) successfully detects the lost TCP connection by actually performing a database query, which exercises the connection and would fail if the connection were terminated:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\n      # Is this connection alive and ready for queries?\\r\\n      def active?\\r\\n        @connection.query 'SELECT 1'\\r\\n        true\\r\\n      rescue PGError\\r\\n        false\\r\\n      end\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis code change was introduced in https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/commit\\/34c7e73c1def1312e59ef1f334586ff2f668246e \\r\\n\\r\\n## To Fix\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no easy way to determine if a TCP socket is dead other than by trying to use the connection (as was done in Rails 3.2.15 and earlier, and is also still used by the mysql adapters).\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, a remotely closed TCP connection can be detected by calling `recv` on the socket. If recv returns a string of length 0, then the remote side has closed the connection. If the socket is non-blocking but has not been closed, it will return an EAGAIN error. However, this approach does not work if there is data buffered on the TCP stream. I attempted to come up with a fix that uses `recv_nonblock` to peek ahead in the stream:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\n      def socket_alive?\\r\\n        socket = Socket.for_fd(@connection.socket)\\r\\n        socket.autoclose = false\\r\\n        socket.recv_nonblock(1, Socket::MSG_PEEK) != ''\\r\\n      rescue Errno::EAGAIN\\r\\n        true\\r\\n      end\\r\\n\\r\\n      # Is this connection alive and ready for queries?\\r\\n      def active?\\r\\n        socket_alive? && @connection.connect_poll != PG::PGRES_POLLING_FAILED\\r\\n      rescue PGError\\r\\n        false\\r\\n      end\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if the server closes the connection, as it does during `test_reconnection_after_actual_disconnection_with_verify`, it sends a final message to the client that won't have been consumed yet when `socket_alive?` runs:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n[3] pry(#<ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter>)> socket.recv_nonblock(1000, Socket::MSG_PEEK)\\r\\n=> \\\"E\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00mSFATAL\\\\x00C57P01\\\\x00Mterminating connection due to administrator command\\\\x00Fpostgres.c\\\\x00L2855\\\\x00RProcessInterrupts\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is actually a deeper problem here involving a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) weakness where the connection might die after checking the connection but before trying to use it. A better solution would be to detect the dead connection while trying to use it, and to then attempt to reestablish the connection when it dies.

Here's an example, assuming I have the following files:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n- apps\\r\\n  - controllers\\r\\n    - api\\r\\n      - v1\\r\\n        - api_foo_controller.rb\\r\\n      - application_controller.rb\\r\\n    - foo_controller.rb\\r\\n    - application_controller.rb\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe definition of the classes are as followed:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nclass ApplicationController\\r\\nclass FooController < ApplicationController ; end\\r\\n\\r\\nmodule Api\\r\\n  module V1\\r\\n    class ApiFooController < ApplicationController ; end\\r\\n  end\\r\\nend\\r\\n\\r\\nmodule Api\\r\\n  class ApplicationController ; end\\r\\nend\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the request hits `::FooController` first, Rails loads `::FooController` and `::ApplicationController` and things work fine for `::FooController`. If the request then hits `Api::V1::ApiFooController`, Rails won't load `Api::ApplicationController` so `Api::V1::ApiFooController` ends up inheriting from `::ApplicationController` instead of `Api::ApplicationController`. Note that this only happens in development mode where `cache_classes` is turned off. And it only happens when there're two classes with the same name but in differnt namespaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is due to Rails' autoloading [overrides `const_missing`](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/master\\/activesupport\\/lib\\/active_support\\/dependencies.rb#L177-L184) and lazy loading of classes on incoming requests. For the second request in the above example, there's no `const_missing` call since Ruby finds the constant `::ApplicationController` by chasing up the namespaces (self -> v1 -> api -> root), causing the meaning of the program to change. Note that if the request hits `Api::V1::ApiFooController` first, things work as expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo solve the problem, I would suggest to change Rails' autoloading implementation to load all objects when it starts even in development mode, so that it has a global view of the object graph. That will prevent Ruby from loading the wrong class (e.g. `Api::ApplicationController`). The rest of the autoloading logic should be unchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nA working example is available [here](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/jingweno\\/rails_reload). \\r\\n\\r\\nFor now I am renaming `Api::ApplicationController` to make it unique in the code base (e.g., `Api::ApiApplicationController`) to temporarily solve the problem.

Explicit locking is not so easily done and is prone to missing some code paths. As the amount of explicit locks increases, so does the probability of deadlocks. Locks are slightly slower than lock-free volatile reads and scale horribly as the concurrency level increases.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevious pull request: #6917.\"","date":"2012-12","title":"\"Thread safety improvements\"","ismerged":"true","repo":"rails/rails","openclose":"close"},"623":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/8431","body":"\"Fix issue where schema.rb has incompatible :version option.\"","date":"2012-12","title":"\"dump schema.rb without :version option\"","ismerged":"true","repo":"rails/rails","openclose":"close"},"624":{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/8399","body":"\"This change adds three metadata columns to the schema_migrations table.

I may have a chance this week to test in a real application, but for now I only have my two benchmark scripts ar_test.rb (for JRuby) and ar_test_mri.rb. Notably, I have not tested the behavior when connections are removed explicitly or removed by the reaper.\\n\\nI also do not understand the distinction between PoolFullError and ConnectionTimeoutError.  I also introduced an @available array of connections ready to be checked out.

The first ensures the connection pool is fair by queuing up several waiting threads and ensuring they acquire connections in order as connections are made available.  The connections are trickled in one by one because we don't actually care when two connections become available that order is strictly preserved.\\n\\nThe second queues up two groups of waiting threads, then checks in enough connections for group 1 all at once.  The test ensures that only the group 1 threads acquired connections.\\n\\nA third test is the money test but was removed because it was unreliable.

It requires some restructuring and slight uglification of the ConnectionPool.checkout method. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a tricky one. I have a test, but due to the race condition nature of the bug, it only sometimes fails, so I didn't include it it in the pull commit not sure if that was appropriate, but it's included below. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem occurs when you have a lot of threads (more than connection pool size) all wanting to checkout connections for very very short periods of time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConceptually, this ought to be accommodated no problem. Each thread only needs the connection for a very short period of time, orders of magnitude less than the timeout -- even if there's more of them then there are connections, they should each be able to take a turn, waiting when neccesary and all finishing long before timeout no problem. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, _sometimes_ (race condition, so it appears in some runs and not others), some of these threads will end up raising a ConnectionTimeoutError  --- **long before** the timeout value is reached. They appear to be giving up and not getting a connection in miliseconds, long before the 5 second time out. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? As far as I can tell, here's the deal.  \\r\\n\\r\\n* threadA wants a connection, but the pool is full, so it blocks on [`@queue.wait(@timeout)`](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/3-2-stable\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/connection_adapters\\/abstract\\/connection_pool.rb#L246)\\r\\n\\r\\n* shortly thereafter, threadB checks in a connection, and does a [`@queue.signal`](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/3-2-stable\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/connection_adapters\\/abstract\\/connection_pool.rb#L270)\\r\\n\\r\\n* this does wake up threadA, however threadA does not immediately get access to the mutex to be in it's 'synchronization' block. Some *other* thread slips into 'synchronization' first, checks out the newly avail conenction, and then at a later point threadA gets access to the mutex 'synchronization' block\\r\\n  * It [finds there are no connections available](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/3-2-stable\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/connection_adapters\\/abstract\\/connection_pool.rb#L248), assumes this means that it only woke up from `@queue.wait` because of a timeout, and throws the ConnectionTimeoutError . But the 5 seconds hadn't elapsed, hardly any time at all elapsed, it got woken up because there was a checkin, another thread just stole it first. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt first this seemed to be like it must be a bug in ruby Monitor\\/ConditionVariable itself, or else ConnectionPool somehow not synchronizing in enough places, or something. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, reading up on how Monitors and ConditionVariables work, this seems like *one* accepted model for the way they work -- and appears to be how ruby works.  The [wikipedia article on Monitors](http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Monitor_(synchronization)) refers to these two models as \\\"blocking condition variables\\\" and [\\\"non-blocking condition variables\\\"](http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Monitor_(synchronization)#Nonblocking_condition_variables)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis [article on Java](http:\\/\\/www.baptiste-wicht.com\\/2010\\/09\\/java-concurrency-part-5-monitors-locks-and-conditions\\/) refers to the two categories instead as \\\"Signal & Continue\\\" (non-blocking) and \\\"Signal & Wait\\\" (blocking), and says Java uses the \\\"Signal & Continue\\\" method:\\r\\n\\r\\n> Signal & Continue (SC) : The process who signal keep the mutual exclusion and the signaled will be awaken but need to acquire the mutual exclusion before going.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat appears to be what ruby is doing too, although Monitor rdoc doesn't specify, and I wasn't able to understand the code enough to be sure -- that matches observed behavior here. So, the process which signals keeps the mutex, the signaled awakens but just gets added to the queue to aquire the mutex to operate in it's 'synchronized' block, and other threads may in front of it. Yep, that's happening. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere's a test case which on my machine fails in about 80% of runs. Tested with both MRI 1.9.3-p0 and jruby 1.6.7 in 1.8.7 mode.

(adding more runs to the `10 times` may make it more likely to fail) Note that if you run just this test by itself, on failure run, it completes with failure in _way_ less than the 5 second timeout, even though it reports a failure due to ConnectionTimeoutError \\\"could not get connection in 5 seconds.\\\"  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the included pull request, I was not able to get the test to fail in a bunch of runs -- and additionally my much more complex app no longer exhibited the problematic behavior I was seeing, where it raised ConnectionTimeoutError's when I didn't see any reason why, unless given a larger connection pool than seemed like should be neccesary. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe restructure in the pull request changes the order of operations in the loop in `#checkout`, but it also has to do some ugly things with keeping track itself of how long it slept during the `@queue.wait`. I couldn't think of any other way for it to determine whether the timeout was really up, in cases where it returned from `@queue.wait` with a connection still unavailable. It may execute multiple `@queue.wait`s in successive loop iterations.  The total of all of them should be no more than _approximately_ the timeout value, as it keeps a running count of waiting time.  This is neccessarily not _exactly_ the `@timeout` value because there's really no way to get that exact measure, but it'll be pretty close, and should be good enough for what `@timeout` is meant to accomplish. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot sure if there's an existing test that asserts that when a thread really _can't_ get a connection it does raise ConnectionTimeout, and in about 5 seconds -- but I verified myself this was still true post-commit. (such a test would take 5 seconds to complete, which would be annoying, unless perhaps using a pool with a much smaller timeout). \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is against 3-2-stable, as was all my work.

The list of parameters varies between different PostgreSQL versions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent behavior of connection settings for adapter postgresql is inconsistent. Some connection parameters can be set by the connection specification only (:port, :database) but not per environment variable (PGPORT, PGDATABASE).

We freeze in the destroy call.  Is this a problem, or by design?\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: I can call freeze_without_memoizable ahead of time and this won't happen.

All of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn potsdam I'd memoized 2 API calls so that I could delegate methods to them, and only call the API once per request guaranteed.  This meant I dished out 2 API calls each time I was entirely done with an object and didn't want to mess with it anymore.  This is silly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't use memoizable until they fix this.

Dependencies are now managed in the .gemspec file where possible. Comments have been added to both files explaining dependency management choices.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the .gemspec file has been updated to include more meta-information, such as author and email.

I suggest it is thus changed to:\\n\\n```ruby\\ndef select(sql, name = nil)\\n  fields, rows = select_raw(sql, name)\\n  rows.map do |row|\\n    Hash[fields.zip(row)]\\n  end\\nend\\n```\\n\\nThis version is obviously faster to some degree, but under Ruby 1.9.2 the difference is much larger than one would maybe expect.

If the app developer desires a count of a limited set (e.g. the number of records that will be shown on the next page) of a ginormous table, they won't have to choose between instantiating the records (to use Array#length) and having the database count every row in the table that matches before returning.  With this approach, the database will shortcut its count as soon as it collects offset + limit rows.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. If an app ever does a count(:limit => 0) in some corner case, we don't have to hit the database at all.  We can just return zero.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the fact that then count == length == size, so this issue is resolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttached is a patch that implements what I described.  Note that I also changed the tests for issue 6268, as if this approach is acceptable, those constraints would no longer apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the \\\"why'd he do that?\\\" side of things, since Arel doesn't support subqueries, there's some trickery to make that happen in calculations.build_count_subquery.  I'd really like to be able to do this inside Arel, but it appears that's not possible right now.  Given that relational algebra doesn't define limit and offset, Arel could alternatively change the behavior of its own count operation for future versions in a similar way without opening the floodgates to generic subqueries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmittedly this patch is pretty edgy because of the Arel workaround, so even if you buy the semantic change, I could see wanting to change the behavior at the Arel layer instead.  I just wanted to submit this as a proof of concept (all tests pass on the 4 default DB drivers) and see what people think.  Likewise, there may be legitimate reasons that this approach isn't desirable.

After calculation, [it puts the calculated name on an internal cache on that class object](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/ruby\\/ruby\\/blob\\/trunk\\/variable.c#L203-213).

I'll try to describe the issue, and maybe other people (like @jonleighton) know of a trivial fix.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main problem is that the implementation of the generated method of `has_image` is much more complex than just calling `read_attribute`.  In 3-2-stable, the generated implementation of `has_image` depends on the column type, and looks like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nattr_name = 'has_image'\\r\\nmissing_attribute(attr_name, caller) unless @attributes.has_key?(attr_name)\\r\\n(v=@attributes[attr_name]) && ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLiteColumn.value_to_boolean(v)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThat **generated code** has the knowledge of how to typecast.  In other words, the casting code is defined inside the method when it's generated.  Unfortunately this generated code never calls `read_attribute`.  If we take a look at [the implementation of `read_attribute` in 3-2-stable](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/3-2-stable\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/attribute_methods\\/read.rb#L123-127), we'll see that it calls a class method [`type_cast_attribute`](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/3-2-stable\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/attribute_methods\\/read.rb#L40-58).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way `type_cast_attribute` works is to:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Check to see if the method has been generated on an anonymous module.  If it has, it calls that method.\\r\\n2. Check to see if the methods have been generated at all, if not, generate them, include the module, then recurse.\\r\\n3. If the method wasn't defined *and* the methods have been generated, just hand back the value in the attributes hash.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is that since typecasting is embedded in to the generated method, and we're defining a method of the same name as the generated method, the generated method that contains the typecasting information is never called.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompare this to the code that's generated on master.  The generated method source looks like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nread_attribute('has_image') { |n| missing_attribute(n, caller) }\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd [`read_attribute`](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/master\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/attribute_methods\\/read.rb#L119-136) contains the knowledge of typecasting.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm not totally sure how we can fix this on 3-2-stable.

Putting it in ActiveModel meant it should work for any AM-based ORM, including ActiveRecord.  I wrote the tests against ActiveModel, and tested it against my ripple-based app, and it worked great.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> ActiveModel's observer API derives from the [stdlib observer](http:\\/\\/ruby-doc.org\\/stdlib\\/libdoc\\/observer\\/rdoc\\/index.html), which provides a [`notify_observers` method](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/v3.1.0.rc5\\/activemodel\\/lib\\/active_model\\/observing.rb#L106-115) that ORMs can use to trigger the observer callbacks.  This is what ripple uses (and presumably, other AM-based ORMs; I didn't think to check since it's the documented, provided API to trigger observer notification).  My changes for this feature hooked into the [update method](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/v3.1.0.rc5\\/activemodel\\/lib\\/active_model\\/observing.rb#L229-233), which gets called via `notify_observers` by the stdlib observer base class.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> Unfortunately, `ActiveRecord::Observer` skips `notify_observers` entirely--instead it [defines callbacks](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/rails\\/rails\\/blob\\/v3.1.0.rc5\\/activerecord\\/lib\\/active_record\\/observer.rb) to trigger observer notification, rather than using `notify_observers`--which means the enabled\\/disabled state of the observers is not considered.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> So...for the time being, observer enablement\\/disablement does not work with ActiveRecord :(.

Sending us an application that doesn't work as expected is perfectly fine, as you do your best to reduce the moving parts.  The important part is that you give the core team something *tangible* to work with.\\n\\nI am closing this ticket for now, please feel free to reopen it (or file a new ticket) once you have better reproduction steps.\\n\\nThanks for your time, and I hope you understand the position we're in.  :-(\"","issueno":421,"repo":"rails/rails"},"1416":{"date":"2011-05","parent_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/402","body":"\"@sobrinho use foreign keys.

With SSE, the browser keeps a socket open to the server.  The socket won't close until either the server is shutdown, an error happens during transport, or we explicitly close the socket.  Check out the network tab in the dev tools (on Chrome, I'm not sure about the latest Safari).  It *should* show that the socket stays open.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the server shuts down, or we explicitly close the socket, it makes sense that the socket gets closed.

I've been programming in various languages for over 30 years and started with Ruby\\/Rails about 18 months ago.

Looking at the community messages and blogs, this is a constant issue for everyone  Given the dynamic nature of the Rails community, it doesn't seem as if there is ever a moment in time where everything works.   And sometimes Gem authors take it upon themselves to deprecate things without understanding the consequences  I've virtually ever had this experience in Java, C#, C or C++.  To me, this indicates that something better than bundler is needed to manage the release process.
