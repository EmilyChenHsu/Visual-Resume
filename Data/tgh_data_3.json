The app uses a SQLITE3 database with a column type of decimal(12,2) NOT NULL for storing currency values, and sometimes does some correctness and plausibility checks where several values must be equal to others, like a+b+c=d+e+f . In some rare cases the rails app reported that the sum is wrong (i.e. the sum of some values does not equal the sum of other values), although the values in the database are absolutely correct and precise. \\r\\n\\r\\nReason: \\r\\n\\r\\nrails 3\\/activesupport has a problem converting these numbers to BigDecimal values, since in lib\\/active_support\\/core_ext\\/big_decimal\\/conversions to_d is called without a precision parameter.

By \\\"broken\\\", I mean a situation where the string inflection methods are defined, but the inflection rules are not, so that singularize and pluralize just return the string as is.\\n\\nHere's are some examples.  First, the default case, where nothing has been loaded: \\n\\n    $ ruby -e \\\"p 'foo'.pluralize\\\"\\n    -e:1:in `<main>': undefined method `pluralize' for \\\"foo\\\":String (NoMethodError)\\n\\nNext, the case where the inflector is loaded, where it pluralizes correctly:\\n\\n    $ ruby -ractive_support\\/inflector -e \\\"p 'foo'.pluralize\\\"\\n    \\\"foos\\\"\\n\\nFinally, the case where the duration class is loaded, which apparently loads the inflection methods without the default inflections:\\n\\n    $ ruby -ractive_support\\/duration -e \\\"p 'foo'.pluralize\\\"\\n    \\\"foo\\\"\\n\\nThere are two possibilities to fix this:\\n\\n1) Don't load the inflector when the duration class is loaded.   I think that Duration#inspect uses the inflections, so that would have to be modified if you go this route.\\n\\n2) Make it impossible to load the string inflection methods without the default inflections.  This should probably done anyway, as I've seen numerous people bitten by this.  This can be fixed by changing lib\\/active_support\\/core_ext\\/string\\/inflections.rb to require 'active_support\\/inflector' instead of  'active_support\\/inflector\\/methods' and 'active_support\\/inflector\\/transliterate'.\\n\\nNote that I've not tested master, only 3.2.6.

Unsurprisingly, my machine would stop responding during those long GC pauses.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not managed to reproduce with code the long GC pauses, I guess they need to happen inside the Rails rendering pipeline and under a specific memory situation, but I have managed to benchmark a significant improvement when replacing `Symbol#to_proc` with a block:\\r\\n\\r\\n    https:\\/\\/gist.github.com\\/1109416\\r\\n  \\r\\nThe results:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Using ruby 1.8.7 (2011-02-18 patchlevel 334) [i686-darwin10.7.0], MBARI 0x6770, \\r\\n    Ruby Enterprise Edition 2011.03\\r\\n\\r\\n    Rehearsal --------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n    Using Symbol#to_proc   3.520000   0.060000   3.580000 (  3.594295)\\r\\n    Standard call          2.890000   0.020000   2.910000 (  3.038064)\\r\\n    ----------------------------------------------- total: 6.490000sec\\r\\n\\r\\n                               user     system      total        real\\r\\n    Using Symbol#to_proc   3.750000   0.060000   3.810000 (  3.856077)\\r\\n    Standard call          2.690000   0.010000   2.700000 (  2.713586)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I know 3.1 is only offering token Ruby 1.8.7 support and that 3.2 will most likely require 1.9.2, but this can be a real performance problem in real-world applications.

The plural 'octopi' is a neologism, and probably originated as either a joke or a misconception.\\r\\n* There are no attestations of 'viri' being used as the plural of 'virus' in a Latin text. This is not particularly surprising, given that the first known use of the latin 'virus' is in the late 14th century, long after Latin ceased to be a native language and not long before it ceased to be used even for academic writing. There *is* a Latin plural 'viri', but it's of the singular 'vir', meaning 'man'.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I'm on a roll explaining a pull request with a pedantic screed, there are various references below.\\r\\n\\r\\n* http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Plural_form_of_words_ending_in_-us\\r\\n* http:\\/\\/www.etymonline.com\\/index.php?term=virus\\r\\n* http:\\/\\/linuxmafia.com\\/~rick\\/faq\\/plural-of-virus.html\\r\\n* Fowler, *A Dictionary of Modern English Usage*, p. 684 ([Google Books link](http:\\/\\/books.google.co.uk\\/books?id=Z4HI0RQIDK0C&pg=PA684&lpg=PA684&dq=virus+plural+fowler+modern+english+usage&source=bl&ots=wcz_Wz-nLQ&sig=BDQ9RoSDXwsXwjsAVR6dxCVNAng&hl=en&ei=IgaNTdrWOJGbhQe21-W7Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false))\\r\\n* Finally, the Official Scrabble Words lists 'viruses', but not 'viri' or 'virii'\\r\\n\\r\\nTest and documentation changes are, of course, included.

I believe the double colon is a red-herring though, let me explain.\\r\\n\\r\\nActive Support is able to load correctly the `ExampleMailer` constant, the code wouldn't work otherwise. You see `MessagePreview` mentioned in the trace because dependecies.rb kind of emulates looking up the nesting as Ruby does, so first it checks the most nested namespace, which is the one that got the `const_missing` hook called. That's `MessagePreview`. If there is no _message_preview\\/example_mailer.rb_ in `autoload_paths` it goes up to the next outer namespace, ultimately checking `Object`. Since there is an _example_mailer.rb_ in `autoload_paths` it gets interpreted and the mailer defined.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the double colon, the constant name is relative. With the double colon you are telling Ruby to look into `Object` directly, so `MessagePreview.const_missing` is **not** invoked. In particular, we are bypassing accessing the class `MessagePreview` altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's the key I believe, it suggests to me that `MessagePreview` is an autoloaded constant whose class object is being cached somewhere in Rails internals and becomes stale for some reason. That is, the class object itself is stored somewhere, its name is \\\"MessagePreview\\\", but dependencies.rb detects it is no longer reachable using the corresponding constant.\\r\\n\\r\\nI notice both examples have in common that the constant whose class object becomes stale is used in _config\\/routes.rb_, maybe that is meaningful.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill write back as soon as I do any advance.\"","issueno":10685,"repo":"rails/rails"},"3843":{"date":"2013-06","parent_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10685","body":"\"I believe I understand what happens.

When some application file is touched autoloaded constants are wiped, therefore `MessagePreview` is removed from `Object`. But since routes are not reloaded the class object that was stored in that constant is alive and still pointing to the configured path. Not reachable using the constant, but alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a later request comes for action `example` the class that is serving that request is the cached class object whose corresponding constant is gone. The `ExampleMailer` constant is unknown, so `const_missing` is triggered on the orphan class object, and Active Support detects it is stale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution to that is not to have stale objects, probably routing reloading should be also triggered.

However, she also highlighted the lack of diff formats, so basically you have a verb that cannot be used (nowadays there is at least JSON patch). And that is a practical concern, there is no application\\/x-www-form-urlencoded patch format, and browsers are unlikely to implement anything like that anyway, so tunneling PATCH with web forms (still issued with POST) is what we can do *today* to provide a way for people not to issue partial updates with PUT.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe also remarked that since no interoperability problems can be foreseen if people agree on application\\/x-www-form-urlencoded as a delta format you can't say it is wrong either. But the semantics should be defined.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo there is a balance here, on one hand Rails does nothing with PATCH requests except routing, so it is technically agnostic about how Rails applications use the verb. Moreover, Rails does not route based on the MIME type, it routes based on verb + path basically, it is up to the action to validate the request in general. Rails provides the *means* to reply to PATCH requests to avoid PUT for partial updates which are the most common ones in web programming.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on top of that, we have the constraints of the real world, with almost no patch format defined. So the decision was a pragmatic one so to speak, let's push this forward, and let the diff formats come in the future. If they come, we can adapt (for example, someone could provide `update_from_json_patch` in a gem or something and people could switch to that).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, we do not want to promote bad practices, the purpose of this change was precisely to provide the means for Rails applications to be better web citizens.

I don't know if it is even possible, but as a reader of the RFC I'd like to suggest that the wording makes this crystal clear, since I see it is central to the purpose of the verb.\\r\\n\\r\\nNowadays, the only bit in the RFC that says something close to that is in my view \\\"The set of changes is represented in a format called a \\\"patch document\\\" identified by a media type.\\\". This is very ambiguous to me, I can define \\\"set of changes\\\" in any arbitrary way I want, maybe in Swahili. My reading was \\\"you send instructions within a document that has a media type. The media type says which kind of document you get, but the spec is intentionally vague about how changes are to be represented and interpreted\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, for web forms I find hard to believe that such a format is even possible with any practical generality. Since for one people do not use type information and user[age]=24 is ambiguous, it could be that you should set a string or some numeric type (which in turn would be dependent on the server-side technology).

My job title is apparently empty in my profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't claim you cannot still bypass the Unicode validation with some non-visible character, I have not tried it but I bet you could send a control character or something that would pass. That is not the point though because blank is well-defined and doesn't cover those hacks. In any case, Unicode whitespace seems to me to be the most natural modern non-visible notion to base blank on. And that is the rationale behind the current implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanted to explain that without resorting to backwards compat, just the rationale. But of course, regardless of the reasoning, backwards compat would forbid touching the semantics of the method.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince [fast_blank](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/SamSaffron\\/fast_blank) is known, and its trade-offs are known, I believe we have to leave things as they are.

Let me explain why this happens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese inflector methods rely on AS::Dependencies because they perform kind of a recursive `const_get` so to speak, which triggers `const_missing` as needed. The problem is that the interpreter does not pass the resolution algorithm it was running to `const_missing`. Thus, if \\\"X\\\" is an unknown constant, `M::N.const_missing` has no way to distinguish between\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nmodule M\\r\\n  module N\\r\\n    X # ex 1\\r\\n  end\\r\\nend\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nand\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nM::N::X # ex 2\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only information you get is that a module object whose name is \\\"M::N\\\" (in the easy case, it could differ) was asked for a constant with name \\\"X\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAS::Dependencies tries to guess which is the case by inspecting the \\\"parent\\\" modules (again, \\\"parent\\\" is ill-defined, but in the easy case we take the module object stored in \\\"M\\\" as parent). If `M` happens to have \\\"X\\\" then there was a constant path involved for sure (ex 2), because it cannot be the case that ex 1 triggers `const_missing`.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what if `M` does not have \\\"X\\\" at that point? Well, you just do not have the information, it could be ex 1, or it could be ex 2. You don't know. In that edge case, as a compromise, AS::Dependencies assumes ex 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your first example `Namespace1` is not known to contain \\\"Klass1\\\", so AS::Dependencies assumes ex 1. In the second case all constants are known and we are able to conclude the lookup should fail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbeit the inflector knows the algorithm, the method is written in a way such that\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\n\\\"M::N::X\\\".constantize\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nbehaves as autoloading\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nM::N::X\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a pity that AS::Dependencies differs from Ruby constant name lookup in cases like this, but the API is limited and you cannot do better.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ideal solution would be to base all this on `Kernel#autoload`, but that is also impossible as of today.\\r\\n\"","issueno":9286,"repo":"rails/rails"},"3980":{"date":"2013-02","parent_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9211","body":"\"Cool, thanks for contributing this.\\r\\n\\r\\nFWIW these are Active Record methods, rather than Arel methods.

Let me give you some feedback on the proposal:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I understand the intention of introducing the ObjectSerializer, as I suggested previously I'd prefer to decorate `Marshal.load`. I mean, `alias_method_chain` decoration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ObjectSerializer class would introduce a new contract that all cache stores, core and plugins, should use. Note that the very memcache store the patch updates does **not** use the new `dump`. So it is no following the contract, if we change `dump` later the store won't use the new version.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing is that the mismatch is not really in `ActiveSupport::Cache` vs constant autoloading. That's a symptom of the core issue. The core of this problem is that constant autoloading does not play well with `Marshal.load`. That affects to *any* usage of `Marshal.load`, either there or anywhere else, including direct usage by the end user.

(See http:\\/\\/tenderlovemaking.com\\/2012\\/06\\/18\\/removing-config-threadsafe.html.)\\n\\nAs you know, the post analyses what the flag implies and its impact in several runtime environments. It concludes that in multi-process Rack::Lock is superfluous. The corollary of the post is that the threadsafe flag does little harm to multi-process apps.\\n\\nAlright, but that is not the end of the story. We need to put ourselves on the shoes of the end-user. One of our majority of users that plan to run Unicorn or Passenger goes and sees the threadsafe flag enabled. Not only he wonders about the implications on booting the application, the problem is that he wonders whether that flag means *his* code should be thread-safe.\\n\\n    config.threadsafe!\\n\\nThis is set, and the name is clear and it has even an exclamation mark, therefore Rails could be assuming somehow **my application** is thread-safe.\\n\\nAnd of course, if your target is multi-process you do not write and should not bother to write thread-safe code. So our beloved user goes and turns the flag to false to be totally sure there's no misunderstanding.\\n\\nAs a consequence, statistically speaking, the vast majority of our users are going to need to comment out that line. And in my book that means the default value for the flag is wrong.\\n\\nLet me repeat I express my opinion about which should be the generated default value. I am not talking about how should people deploy their apps.\\n\\nIf the day arrives where JRuby and Puma are the dominant production platforms, then I'll vote for having the flag enabled by default.\\n\\nFinally, the post then speculates about removing the config option altogether. But as already noted here that's not going to be possible as long as we configure stuff per environment, since AS constant autoloading (dependencies) is not thread-safe because it is based on `const_missing`. Well, I am not 100% sure, but I don't think Ruby stops the world until `const_missing` returns (please someone correct that if I am wrong).

It all depends on your environment. I am talking about applications. Rails should be thread-safe, and plugins should be thread-safe. Applications? Let's leave that choice to their authors.\\n\\n@tarcieri of course, we are talking natural language and in natural language you hardly can use a `forall` quantifier. When I say \\\"you do not write\\\" I mean \\\"the majority of people do not write\\\". At least in my experience. I don't mean \\\"absolutely nobody does not write\\\", I mean \\\"generally speaking\\\", \\\"most people\\\", the people I have in mind for choosing a default value.\\n\\nNevertheless, I am sure we guys have a lot of common goals. Let's focus in what I believe we have in common. I think everyone in this thread (including me) would agree on the following:\\n\\n1) We'd like that thread-safety was a first-class citizen in Ruby on Rails. We want to get rid of the \\\"stigma\\\" of having to enable this by hand. To be clear, that **does not** mean we send the message that people *should* deploy multi-threaded applications, that's a different discussion, we send the message multi-thread and multi-process as far as framework support etc. are *on-par*.\\n\\n2) We all agree that enabling this flag has no impact that we can foresee in general in the typical multi-process application that runs under Passenger and Unicorn. In fact, most preloading has already being done under REE to play nice with copy & write. We are basically changing the way things boot, and that could just be a fact \\\"Rails boots this way by default in production mode\\\".\\n\\n3) A movement like this would send the message that plugin authors are *expected* to write thread-safe code, we all like that idea.\\n\\nMy only concern is: I'd like to do this switch provided it is crystal clear that people in 2) have nothing to worry about. I think the current flag name is unclear. And I don't like to resort to documentation for this. The solution should be elegant.

If your API requires a full representation (except perhaps for some internal stuff like cache counts), update_attributes allows you to store one just fine.\\r\\n\"","issueno":505,"repo":"rails/rails"},"4673":{"date":"2011-12","parent_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/505","body":"\"(With infinite love to @tenderlove).\\r\\n\\r\\n@mikekelly Ruby on Rails does not define HTTP semantics, as a web framework it has to provide *means to its users to be able to adhere to them if they want to*, promote proper usage of them, and still allow users to do delete via GET and partial updates via PUT (ie, promoting, not lecturing).\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, to toggle the paid flag of an invoice and follow proper HTTP semantics, you have to make that flag a resource. That's for me a conclusion of this thread, based on quotes from Roy Fielding.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the topic of the thread is: *given* these definitions, what should Rails do next? Perhaps the answer is PATCH, or perhaps is nothing, we still don't know.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if Rails had some sort of support for PATCH, you still would not be able to do idempotent partial updates and adhere to HTTP semantics at the same time. That's just how things are defined, it's not under the control of Rails. To discuss the convenience of this you need to discuss with the HTTP guys, not the Rails guys.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"","issueno":505,"repo":"rails/rails"},"4674":{"date":"2011-12","parent_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/505","body":"\"@mikekelly I don't say this is the only valid interpretation. At the beginning of the thread it was my reading of the spec, and it was what other sources interpreted. It is also clear that we are not inventing this controversy, it is old.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this thread, we have a pulse of the generic consensus and Roy Fielding's view on this topic. And I believe that opinion is key. If Roy said \\\"go do partial updates with PUT\\\" we had already closed the PR.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis tells me that if I have to bet, I know where to bet. Not saying the other interpretation is wrong. The spec is ambiguous, so there's no right or wrong. It could be the case that the ambiguity was an overlook, I personally don't know. But what we have is consensus (different from unanimity), and the +1 of Roy Fielding regarding not doing partial updates with PUT.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, Rails is (probably) going to provide a way for the majority of people participating in this thread that would like to do partial updates without PUT. At the same time, you will be able to continue doing partial updates via PUT.\\r\\n\\r\\nMind you, if we do something I don't expect it to be a dramatic change. At least at the beginning. It could be something discreet, like being able to say :method => :patch, and adding routing and conventions without changing defaults. Backwards compatibility must be respected, and indeed you may be doing form_for with a full-representation, which is the canonical use case of form_for reused in create and update views.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yes, adhering to the spec\\/semantics is enough for me to consider adding support for this. Why does Rails support DELETE? Couldn't people delete via POST? Sure, and we are doing it all the time, but that's irrelevant, it is the duty of Rails to give you a way to do proper DELETE.
